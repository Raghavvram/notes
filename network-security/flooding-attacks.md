# Flooding Attacks

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-15

A flooding attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that overwhelms a target with a large volume of traffic. The goal of a flooding attack is to consume all of the target's available resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Types of Flooding Attacks

There are many different types of flooding attacks, each of which targets a different protocol or service.

### 1. SYN Flood

A SYN flood is a type of DoS attack that exploits the TCP handshake process. The attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system, but never completes the handshake by sending the final ACK. This consumes server resources, making it unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

### 2. UDP Flood

A UDP flood is a type of DoS attack in which the attacker overwhelms the target with User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. Since UDP is a connectionless protocol, the target system will try to process each packet, consuming resources.

### 3. ICMP Flood

An ICMP flood, also known as a Ping flood, is a DoS attack that overwhelms the target with ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets. The target system will respond with ICMP Echo Reply packets, consuming resources.

### 4. HTTP Flood

An HTTP flood is a type of DoS attack that sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server. This can overwhelm the server, making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.

### 5. DNS Flood

A DNS flood is a type of DoS attack that sends a large number of DNS requests to a DNS server. This can overwhelm the server, making it unresponsive to legitimate DNS queries.

### 6. Other Flooding Attacks

In addition to the attacks listed above, there are many other types of flooding attacks, including:

*   **SMTP Flood:** An SMTP flood is a DoS attack that sends a large number of SMTP requests to an SMTP server.
*   **ARP Flood:** An ARP flood is a DoS attack that sends a large number of ARP requests to a network.
*   **NTP Flood:** An NTP flood is a DoS attack that sends a large number of NTP requests to an NTP server.
*   **SIP Flood:** A SIP flood is a DoS attack that sends a large number of SIP requests to a SIP server.

## Mitigation

There are a number of steps that can be taken to mitigate the risk of a flooding attack, including:

*   **Firewalls:** Firewalls can be used to block traffic from known malicious IP addresses.
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** An IDS can be used to detect and alert on suspicious traffic.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting can be used to limit the number of requests that a server will accept from a particular IP address over a certain period of time.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** A CDN can help to absorb and mitigate the traffic from a flooding attack.
