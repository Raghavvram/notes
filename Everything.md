### The complete walkthrough of how a modern computer system works under the hood when performing tasks like opening a browser, switching to a text editor, typing, and returning to the browser to watch a YouTube video. This explanation will cover the roles of the CPU, memory, process management, and input/output (I/O) in great detail.

---

### **Step 1: System Boot and Environment Setup (Precursor)**
Before we even begin, the operating system is already running, managing resources, and waiting for user input. Key components already in place:
- The **CPU** is executing the operating system kernel, managing processes, and waiting for user commands.
- **Memory (RAM)** stores the OS and actively running processes, while the hard disk (or SSD) stores installed programs and data.
- Input devices (e.g., keyboard and mouse) and output devices (e.g., monitor) are active and ready for interaction.

---

### **Step 2: User Opens the Browser**
#### a) **User Input:**
- The user clicks the browser icon (e.g., Google Chrome) using the mouse.
- The operating system (OS) captures this input via the **Interrupt Request (IRQ)** system, which interrupts the CPU, informing it about the mouse click.

#### b) **Process Creation:**
- The OS identifies the click action as a request to open the browser.
- The browser's program file is located on the **storage device** (e.g., SSD).
- The OS creates a **new process** for the browser by:
  - Allocating memory (RAM) for the browser’s code and data.
  - Initializing the **Process Control Block (PCB)** to track this process.

#### c) **Memory Management:**
- The browser's executable file is loaded into memory.
  - **Code Segment:** Stores the browser’s instructions (binary code).
  - **Data Segment:** Includes global/static variables (e.g., user preferences).
  - **Heap:** Allocates memory dynamically for tasks like rendering web pages.
  - **Stack:** Manages function calls, local variables, and parameters.

#### d) **CPU Execution:**
- The CPU starts executing the browser’s instructions:
  - **Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle:** The CPU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them.
  - Registers hold temporary data (e.g., the current instruction and memory addresses).

#### e) **I/O Operations:**
- The browser initializes its user interface (UI):
  - The CPU sends commands to the **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** to render the browser window.
  - The monitor displays the browser UI as output.

### **Step 3: User Switches to a Text Editor**
#### a) **User Input:**
- The user clicks on the text editor icon in the taskbar.
- The OS handles the mouse click using an interrupt, as before.

#### b) **Context Switching:**
- The CPU saves the state of the browser process (e.g., program counter, registers) into its PCB.
- The OS schedules the text editor process for execution using a **scheduling algorithm** (e.g., Round Robin, Priority Scheduling).
- The CPU loads the text editor's PCB and resumes its execution.

#### c) **Process Management:**
- If the text editor is already running, the OS switches to its process.
- If it’s being opened for the first time, the OS creates a new process following the same steps as in Step 2.

#### d) **Memory Management:**
- The text editor’s code, data, heap, and stack are loaded into memory.
- The OS ensures that memory regions for the text editor and browser are isolated.

#### e) **User Interaction:**
- As the user types into the text editor:
  - **Keyboard Input:** Keystrokes generate hardware interrupts.
  - The OS captures the input and sends it to the text editor process.
  - The text editor updates its UI to reflect the user’s input, with the CPU processing each update and the GPU rendering it.

### **Step 4: User Switches Back to the Browser**
#### a) **User Input:**
- The user clicks the browser window.
- The OS detects this click and prepares for another **context switch**.

#### b) **Context Switching:**
- The CPU saves the state of the text editor process in its PCB.
- It loads the state of the browser process from its PCB.

---

### **Step 5: User Watches a YouTube Video**
#### a) **Network Request:**
- The user types a URL or clicks on a video link.
- The browser sends a **network request** to the YouTube server over the internet:
  - The CPU constructs the request and hands it over to the **network interface card (NIC)**.
  - The NIC transmits the request through the router/modem to the internet.

#### b) **Receiving the Video Stream:**
- The YouTube server responds with a video stream, which is received by the NIC.
- The NIC transfers the data to the OS, which forwards it to the browser.

#### c) **Decoding the Video:**
- The browser decodes the video data:
  - The **CPU** handles general decoding tasks.
  - The **GPU** is used for hardware-accelerated video decoding and rendering.

#### d) **Audio and Video Output:**
- The video frames are rendered by the GPU and displayed on the monitor.
- The audio stream is sent to the sound card, which outputs the sound through speakers or headphones.
