#### DDR6 RAM is the next generation of RAM technology for PCs, servers, and notebooks. It's expected to be released in the next few years. 
### Features
- Higher capacity: DDR6 RAM may support up to 128 GB per DIMM (Dual In-line Memory Module). 
- Improved data integrity: DDR6 may include advanced error-correcting code (ECC) mechanisms. 
- Backward compatibility: DDR6 is designed to be compatible with existing memory technologies. 
- Scalability: DDR6 can meet the needs of various computing environments. 
- Lower power consumption: DDR6 may consume less power than DDR5. 
- Higher performance: DDR6 may offer higher performance than DDR5. 
- More memory channels: DDR6 may have four memory channels per module, which is double the number of DDR5. 
- More memory banks: DDR6 may have 64 memory banks per module, which is double the number of DDR4. 
DDR6 is expected to replace DDR5 memory over the next few years. It may become the standard memory for high-performance computers and servers.
