# TFLOPS (Teraflops)

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-15

TFLOPS (teraflops) is a unit of measurement used to quantify the performance of a processor, particularly a GPU. It represents one trillion floating-point operations per second.

## What are Floating-Point Operations?

A floating-point operation is a mathematical calculation involving numbers with a fractional part. These operations are more complex than integer operations and are essential for scientific, engineering, and graphical applications.

## Why is TFLOPS Important?

TFLOPS is a key metric for evaluating the performance of hardware in several domains:

*   **Gaming:** In gaming, TFLOPS is a measure of a GPU's graphical power. A higher TFLOPS value generally translates to better performance, allowing for higher resolutions, frame rates, and graphical settings.
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** In AI, TFLOPS is used to measure the performance of hardware for training and running deep learning models. Many AI applications rely on high-precision floating-point calculations.
*   **Scientific Computing:** Scientific simulations and modeling often require a massive number of floating-point operations. A high TFLOPS value is crucial for these applications.

## TFLOPS Comparison

While TFLOPS is a useful metric, it's not the only factor that determines a device's performance. Other factors, such as memory bandwidth, clock speed, and architecture, also play a significant role.

Here are some examples of TFLOPS in different devices:

| Device              | TFLOPS      |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Xbox Series X       | 12          |
| PlayStation 5       | 10.28       |
| NVIDIA RTX 4090     | 82          |
