# DDR6 SDRAM

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-15

DDR6 (Double Data Rate 6) SDRAM is the next-generation standard for random-access memory (RAM). It is the successor to DDR5 and is expected to offer significant improvements in performance, capacity, and power efficiency.

## Key Features of DDR6

*   **Higher Bandwidth:** DDR6 is expected to have a data rate of up to 12,800 MT/s, which is double the maximum data rate of DDR5.
*   **Increased Capacity:** DDR6 will support higher density memory chips, allowing for larger capacity DIMMs.
*   **Lower Power Consumption:** DDR6 will use a lower operating voltage than DDR5, resulting in lower power consumption.
*   **Improved Channel Architecture:** DDR6 will use a four-channel architecture per DIMM, which is double the number of channels in DDR5. This will allow for higher memory bandwidth and improved performance.
*   **Advanced ECC:** DDR6 will feature more advanced error-correcting code (ECC) mechanisms to improve data integrity.

## DDR6 vs. DDR5

| Feature             | DDR6                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Max Data Rate**   | 12,800 MT/s                                |
| **Operating Voltage**| 1.0V                                       |
| **Channel Architecture**| Four channels per DIMM                     |
| **ECC**             | More advanced ECC                          |

## Availability

DDR6 is still in the early stages of development, and it is not expected to be available until 2025 or later. However, it is expected to become the new standard for high-performance computing and servers.
